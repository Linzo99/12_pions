## Game Rules

### Setup
- Played on a 5x5 board
- Each player starts with 12 pieces
- Pieces move orthogonally (up, down, left, right)

### Basic Rules
1. **Movement**
   - Regular pieces move one space orthogonally
   - Kings can slide multiple spaces orthogonally
   - Kings can jump over friendly pieces

2. **Captures**
   - Pieces capture by jumping over opponent pieces
   - Captures are mandatory
   - Multiple captures in one turn are required when possible
   - The captured piece is removed from the board

3. **Kings**
   - Regular pieces become kings when reaching the opposite end
   - Kings have enhanced movement capabilities
   - Kings can make long-range captures

4. **Winning**
   - Capture all opponent pieces to win
   - Game is drawn when both players have only one king each
