## Game Rules

### Setup
- Played on a 5Ã—5 board
- Each player starts with 12 pieces arranged on opposite sides
- Player 1 (bottom) moves first, aiming to reach the top row
- Player 2 (top/AI) moves second, aiming to reach the bottom row

### Core Mechanics
1. **Movement**
   - Regular pieces move one space orthogonally (forward, left, right)
   - Kings can slide any number of spaces orthogonally (like a rook in chess)
   - Kings can jump over friendly pieces

2. **Capturing**
   - Pieces capture by jumping over opponent pieces onto an empty space
   - **All captures are mandatory** - you must capture when possible
   - Multiple captures in sequence are required when available
   - Captured pieces are removed from the board

3. **Promotion**
   - Regular pieces are promoted to kings upon reaching the opposite end of the board
   - Kings have enhanced movement and capture abilities

4. **Victory Conditions**
   - Capture all opponent pieces
   - Block opponent so they have no legal moves
   - A draw occurs when both players have only one king each
